## Monero Typography
Monero Outreach | 09/30/18
You, and only you can prevent typography fires.

The “Monero Font” is modified Century Gothic which was released by Monotype in 1991. It was based on Futura, designed by Paul Renner in 1927. You can see here, that the E and the R are different, also the O is scaled slightly.

### Introducing: MoneroGothic.otf

This version restores the Monero oddities and glyphs have been added to support XX languages and webfont kits have been created. We release our version under the Creative Commons licence which means that you need acknowlege credit that we're copying Monotype, like they copied from Renner who probably ripped off some lost bauhaus crypto wiz. Available only in bold, for the bold.
